# checkerboard-printer
Dynamic checkerboard printer - a simple program to print a chessboard of varying size
and with a variable character for shading black squares.

The program is simple but is here because I consider the code well commented.

The project starts as it does in version control because this program is the
result of a class assignment where we were to make 3 structural improvements
to an existing code template.
